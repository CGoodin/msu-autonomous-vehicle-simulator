# The MSU Autonomous Vehicle Simulator

The MSU Autonomous Vehicle Simulator (MAVS) is

* A software library for simulating autonomous vehicles in realistic digital terrain.
* A real-time simulator for evaluating the performance of autonomous perception and navigation software.
* A physics-based sensor simulator for LIDAR, GPS, cameras, and other sensors.

Instructions for building, installing, and using MAVS can be found in the [documentation](https://cgoodin.github.io/msu-autonomous-vehicle-simulator/).
